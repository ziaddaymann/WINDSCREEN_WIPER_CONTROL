# WINDSCREEN_WIPER_CONTROL

The automated rain wiper system is used to detect rainfall and
activate automobile rain wiper automatically without driver interaction. The
system is developed to mitigate driving distractions and allow drivers to
focus on their primary task of driving. The distraction eliminated with the
development of this product is the manual adjustment of windshield wipers
when driving in precipitation. The few seconds that a driver takes their
attention off the road to adjust a knob while driving in poor weather
conditions could potentially lead to car accidents.

Implementation of windscreen wiper that can
detect rain through humidity sensor and take an action through Red Led
and each sensor/actuation need to communicate its data/state with the
other sensor through CAN bus

By using Tiva C Microcontroller
